## Solution Types

**Solve (Least Blocks):**
  Attempts to solve the puzzle using the fewest pieces possible.

**Solve (Use Most Abundant) - Recommended:**
  Prioritizes using whichever pieces you have the most of. For example, if you have 15 S-shaped pieces and only 3 of every other piece, this option will try to use the S pieces first.
